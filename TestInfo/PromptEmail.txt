Q1-Q4 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below methods.

Q1 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below methods

local function releaseStorage(player)
player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
end

function onLogout(player)
if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
end
return true
end


Q2 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below method

function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
local guildName = result.getString("name")
print(guildName)
end


Q3 - Fix or improve the name and the implementation of the below method

function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)
player = Player(playerId)
local party = player:getParty()

for k,v in pairs(party:getMembers()) do
if v == Player(membername) then
party:removeMember(Player(membername))
end
end
end

Q4 - Assume all method calls work fine. Fix the memory leak issue in below method

void Game::addItemToPlayer(const std::string& recipient, uint16_t itemId)
{
Player* player = g_game.getPlayerByName(recipient);
if (!player) {
player = new Player(nullptr);
if (!IOLoginData::loadPlayerByName(player, recipient)) {
return;
}
}

Item* item = Item::CreateItem(itemId);
if (!item) {
return;
}

g_game.internalAddItem(player->getInbox(), item, INDEX_WHEREEVER, FLAG_NOLIMIT);

if (player->isOffline()) {
IOLoginData::savePlayer(player);
}
}


The last 3 tests require setting up & utilizing Open Source TFS & OTC, this is part of the trial itself to confirm your ability to setup a local environment and basic navigation of Github.

Here you can find the base for TFS & OTC
https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver - Please use the 1.4 Release of TFS for the trial
https://github.com/edubart/otclient

Here you can find some guides to help you

Please reproduce the following 3 examples in a clean manner with comments as to why you programmed it the way you did. Please make sure to pay special attention to Question 6 video, we are wanting replication of the shaders in this ability (You can skip this question, as it is a more complex one, but its a big bonus if you manage to complete). Additionally please make sure to send videos of reproduction as well as the source code cleanly in their own files and open a Git Repo (public) with the edits/additions/videos made. Also, make sure to add separated commits for these questions. Q1~Q4 can be a single commit, but Q5~Q7 should be separated.

Sincerely,

Victor
